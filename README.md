# sales-application

The project is a console application, Sales App.

Sales App displays items for sale under four categories. The application user (a customer/buyer) selects a category to browse through and is shown a list of the items available for purchase within that category and the price per item. 

When the user selects an item, the quantity of that item available for purchase is displayed. The user inputs the quantity of the item to purchase. The selected item and the specified quantity by the user is saved in the program shopping bag.

The user may continue selecting items to purchase or not. If the user decides to continue shopping, the application loops back to the process for selecting items into the shopping bag. If the user is satisfied with the selected items, a list of all of the selected items by the user from the various categories is displayed. 

The user is able to remove any items from the \texttt{shopping bag} before proceeding to checkout. The user may also include additional items for purchase when an item is removed erroneously or the user desires an item that was not included in the bag previously.

If the user is satisfied with the selection of items for purchase, a bill is calculated and displayed to the user. The displayed bill is the sum of the prices for all the items selected by the user.
